# NN_OptimizedWithPSO

- Main.py file can run any function selecting it with comments.
- There exist a file prepared to run each function with the parameters that gave the best results in the tests.
- The PSO algorithm is run inside the draw_graph function for 750 iterations.
- In every iteration, draw_graph plots 2 graphs. One with the desired output function and the best solution ever found by the swarm, and another showing the evolution of the MSE.
